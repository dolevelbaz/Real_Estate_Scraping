# Real_Estate_Scraping
scraping real estate data from governmental site.
the scraping is from the site https://www.nadlan.gov.il/. The site contains data about sales properties, including sale price, date of selling, number of rooms, floor, address, block, and the growth on the property price in the last X years.
I used Selenium for this project. I tried to be efficent as possible, but running time is still long.
